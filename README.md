**API**

- all API query parameters have to be splitted with space
- "=" sign is a key/value separator
- FEATURE! files in downloads folder cannot have spaces in names!!!

Possible queries:

- ping
- list
- pull
- push
- exit

parameters:

- host=ip:port
- file=_file_number_
- downloadFromByte=d+
- retransmitToip:host

**API Request regex:**
````
"(list|push|pull|ping|exit)\s*(file=\d+)?\s*(host=[a-zA-Z0-9./]*:[\d]*)?\s*(downloadFromByte=\d+)?\s*(retransmitTo=[a-zA-Z0-9./]*:[\d]*)?\s*"
````
e.g.

- list
- list host=localhost:16900
- pull file=0 host=localhost:16901

If no host is pecified, then first available host from known will be chosen to connect to.

**CONF**

- _application.conf_ - specifies all env variables (You can turn on/off logs and transmission error mock for test)
- _hosts.txt_ - All known hosts routing, when app starts it tries to open socket on each consecutive port from table, if a port is busy it tries another etc.
- _applicationLog.txt_ - when app starts for the first time the file is created. All logs are streamed to this file. Fiel can be dynamically viewed through HttpServer

**HttpServer**
